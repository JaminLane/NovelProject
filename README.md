# NovelProject
This is my Novel project. For this project I decided to combine one of the greatest novels ever written and combine it with a current meme and TV show Peppa Pig. I changed the novel by switching the characters of the book with the characters of the Peppa Pig series. Doing this was fun to do but was difficult because there are many less characters within the Peppa Pig series than there is in the Novel. For some of the groups such as the Lost Boys I had to come up with names so I called them the Barnyard. Not all characters were able to be switched over so there still are some similarities from the original novel and mine but the main characters were all changed.
